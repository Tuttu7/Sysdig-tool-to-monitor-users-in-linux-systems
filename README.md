> If your system has bash, the most commonly used shell out there then all commands executed by normal system users will be stored in the   .bash_history hidden file which is kept in each userâ€™s home directory. The content of this file can be viewed by users, using the history command.

```
cat /home/tuttu/.bash_history
```

The date and time when a command was executed is not shown. This is the default setting on most if not all Linux distributions.

To have a real-time view of the shell commands being run by another user logged in via a terminal or SSH, you can use the Sysdig tool in Linux.

Sydig is an open-source, cross-platform, powerful and flexible system monitoring, analysis and troubleshooting tool for Linux. It can be used for system exploration and debugging.

To install sysdig tool in ubuntu based systems 

```
apt install sysdig
```

Once you have installed sysdig, use the spy_users chisel to spy on users by running the command below.

```
sysdig -c spy_users
```

> Sample output

```
# sysdig -c spy_users
